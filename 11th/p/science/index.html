			<h1>Maze robot science project</h1>
		</header>
		<section class="portfolio-description">
			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We built the robot to demonstrate basic electrical principals. This project is valuable because it gets us familiar with tools that will be useful for the rest of our lives. It is also good to have a project like this because it looks good later in life, when we are applying to colleges</p>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We learned about how electromagnetism is needed for motors to work. We also learned about complete circuits, and how they are needed for electronics to work. We also learned a great deal about friction, and how by using something with a lot of grip like heat-shrink tubing, you can make your robot more efficient.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>

			<h2>Documentation</h2>
			<p>    To make our robot we wanted to do something that no one else had done. We had both had a lot of previous experience with electronics, so we felt confident we could do it. To improve our deign we removed the base, and glued straight to the batteries instead. We both had prior experience with the tools, so instead of learning how to use them, we got in a little practice. Our first attempt at going through the maze failed, because we didnt wire it correctly. once we fixed the wiring so i could reverse, we completed the maze in 16.75 seconds.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p></p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>    During the creation of our robot we faced many failures. However, every time we messed something up, we learned from it. Previous to the project, I mostly liked working by myself, instead of working in a group. However, this project pushed me to be creative, and rely on my team member(s) more. From problems with switches not working, to our robot not reversing, I learned more from making those mistakes, than I would have if I hadn't. Luckily, we also had a great deal of success with our robot. Our biggest success was that our robot made it through. However, that larger success was made of smaller successes, like tuning the switches to be more sensitive, and getting it to work without a base. Even though I had already had previous experience with all of the concepts we learned about, I learned about teamwork. If I had to build another robot, I would have made it so the batteries could have been changed more easily. One thing that I really liked about this project, was the freedom we had to experiment. If I could change something about this project, I wouldn't. This project is great, i cant think of anything you can do to improve it.</p>
